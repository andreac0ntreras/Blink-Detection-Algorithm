# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a package (blinkdetection) that uses an algorithm for blink detection to be used for the analysis of 
data from eye trackers such as Tobii products.

Data from any eyetracker can be analyzed using the scripts in this repository, however, the algorithm was built 
for Tobii products specifically, so be advised that different brands of eyetrackers have different noise
patterns. 

## Cloning the repository
To run this program, enter the following in your command prompt
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/andreac0ntreras/Blink-Detection-Algorithm.git
```

### Navigate to the codebase
Move into the project directory
```commandline
cd ./Blink-Detection-Algorithm
```

### Install the required packages
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The required packages for the program include:
```doctest
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.2.2
matplotlib==3.8.4
pyxdf
plotly
seaborn
```

## Sourcing
Use the code listed in this repository:
https://git.ihmc.us/human-performance/projects/hrp/capture/xdf-parsers/xdf-eyetracker-parser/-/tree/main
to convert the raw data to interim files (located in the _interim_ directory) which we will be using to extract features and blinks from the participant's data.

The data dictionary for the interim files is located in the file
_CAPTURE_Interim_Eyetracker_Files_Data_Dictionary.csv_

## Blink Detection and Feature Extraction
We can now implement our blink detection algorithm. 

The interim CSV files containing the pupil sizes and timestamps for each day and subject are located in the _interim/_ directory

By running the following line in the main.py file, output CSV files called
_compiled_feature_extraction.csv_ and _compiled_blink_extraction.csv_ are 
generated (in the _output/features_ directory) 

_compiled_blink_extraction.csv_ and compiled_blink_df (pd.DataFrame) contain the columns subject, day, 
left_blink_onsets, right_blink_onsets, concat_blink_onsets, right_blink_offsets, left_blink_offsets, 
and concat_blink_offsets 

_compiled_feature_extraction.csv_ and compiled_feature_df (pd.DataFrame) contain the columns subject, day, 
left_ebr, right_ebr, left_ibi, right_ibi, and many others that show the extracted features from 

```doctest
compiled_feature_df, compiled_blink_df = bd.process_csv_files(interim_folder)
```

## Plotting
Finally, using the CSV files generated by 
```doctest
bd.process_xdf_files(folder_path, interim_folder)
```

we can create graphs that plot time against pupil size for each day for each participant. 
Once you run the following line of code in main.py, one plot for each day for each participant will be generated in
the directory (_output/plots_). In addition to the lines that show the trend of left and right pupil size 
against time, there will be horizontal pink, green, red, and yellow lines, where the green represents times at which the blink detection algorithm recognized 
a left eye blink onset, pink represents times at which the blink detection algorithm recognized a left eye blink offset, yellow represents 
times at which the blink detection algorithm recognized a right eye blink onset, and red represents 
times at which the blink detection algorithm recognized a right eye blink offset.
```doctest
bd.plot_all_time_v_pupil_size_csv_files_in_directory(interim_folder, show=True)
```

## Remainder of Main
The remainder of main is experimental code that generates graphs like the following:
![img.png](img.png)
![img_2.png](img_2.png)
Using this line of code 
```doctest
bd.plot_feature_over_three_days(compiled_df, show=True)
```

## Specifications
The hardware used during this experiment is the Tobii Spectrum Pro with a sampling frequency of 600Hz.
