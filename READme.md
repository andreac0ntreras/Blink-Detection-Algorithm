# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop an algorithm for blink detection to be used for the analysis of 
data from eye trackers such as Tobii products.

Data from any eyetracker can be analyzed using the scripts in this repository, however, the algorithm was built 
for Tobii products specifically, so be advised that different brands of eyetrackers have different noise
patterns.
